## Overview

KEVLAR maps a 64-bit Windows kernel driver into a synthetic kernel address space, resolves its imports into host implementations or controlled stubs, builds the minimum kernel environment it needs, and executes `DriverEntry` inside Unicorn—without loading the target driver into the live Windows kernel.

It is designed for driver behavior research, execution tracing, environment-probe analysis, and iterative reconstruction of missing kernel semantics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> KEVLAR is a specialized research harness, not a complete Windows virtual machine. A driver reaching the end of `DriverEntry` does not prove that its returned `NTSTATUS` indicates successful initialization.

## Requirements

- Windows x64
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools or Visual Studio 2022
- **Desktop development with C++** workload
- Windows 10/11 SDK
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer

Dependencies are pinned through `vcpkg.json`:

- [Unicorn 2.1.4](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn)
- [Zydis 4.1.1](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis)
- [Zycore 1.5.2](https://github.com/zyantific/zycore-c)

## Build

The build script locates Visual Studio, restores the static x64 dependencies, and builds the solution:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\build.ps1 Release
```

Build Debug when diagnostics and symbols are required:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 Debug
```

Outputs are separated to prevent Debug and Release configurations from overwriting each other:

```text
builds\Release\KEVLAR.exe
builds\Debug\KEVLAR.exe
```

### Why is there a Unicorn overlay port?

The upstream Unicorn 2.1.4 static CMake build creates a symbolic link during packaging. On Windows that operation requires Developer Mode or elevated symlink privileges. `vcpkg-ports/unicorn/no-symlink.patch` replaces it with an ordinary file copy; no emulator behavior is changed.

## Usage

```powershell
.\builds\Release\KEVLAR.exe C:\path\to\driver.sys
```

Enable focused diagnostics:

```powershell
.\builds\Release\KEVLAR.exe C:\path\to\driver.sys --diag --modreads
```

### Options

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--diag` | Enable detailed diagnostic hooks; significantly slower |
| `--modreads` | Trace reads from mapped system modules |
| `--no-seh` | Disable synthetic SEH dispatch |
| `--intel` | Accepted for compatibility; the coherent Intel profile is always active |
| `--seed <n>` | Deterministic seed for TSC jitter (default is fixed) |
| `--vgk-override` | Convert the configured VGK access-denied result to success |
| `--devirt` | Enable devirtualization-testing behavior |
| `--strict-exports` | Unhandled exports return `STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` instead of `0` |
| `--provenance` | Trace branch decisions + API results for early rejection paths |
| `--blockprof[=secs]` | Hot basic-block profiler: top blocks per interval, loads bucketed by region, guest registers and a VM-state fingerprint on the heartbeat (default dump every 30s) |
| `--trace <file>` | Record a deterministic execution trace |
| `--check <file>` | Replay a trace; report the first divergence |
| `--no-pause` | Skip the final pause; exit ~5s after a no-thread run (automation) |
| `--selftest` | Run the IRQL/APC/DPC/timer self-test and exit (no driver needed) |

### Runtime layout

On first launch, KEVLAR downloads NTDLL and NTOSKRNL symbols into `pdb_cache`. Real system modules can be placed beside the executable when a target requires their actual image; otherwise KEVLAR creates bounded module stubs.

├── KEVLAR.exe
├── pdb_cache/
├── kevlar.log
├── easyanticheat_threads/
└── <driver>/
    ├── vfs/
    └── vreg/
```

## Compatibility

Compatibility is path- and version-specific. Results beyond `DriverEntry` depend on the APIs and kernel behavior exercised by each driver.

| Target family | Current state |
|---|---|
| EAC | Primary target of the original implementation |
| BattlEye | Reported working on tested initialization paths |
| Vanguard | Reported to progress through tested boot-time checks |
| FACEIT | Images map and execute; current drivers reject the synthetic environment early |
| General drivers | Requires implementations for the exact paths exercised |

### Current FACEIT baseline

Before compatibility work, the locally tested FACEIT drivers both reached their entry points and returned the same vendor-specific failure:

| Driver | SHA-256 | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `FACEIT_AC.sys` | `8b26feff7fc5f75b5eaad42e99b4d9c5b6cd779c408e5d882b5549e6de15b6d9` | `DriverEntry → 0xC0EB0001` |
| `FACEIT_IOMMU.sys` | `86f93b3b6d899ec7cd3250866fe22251b875a4de2965da642e0a4f2e2ac91f39` | `DriverEntry → 0xC0EB0001` |

A captured `FACEIT_IOMMU.sys` trace (`builds/Release/faceit-iommu-run.log`) shows the
rejection follows the driver's early platform checks: an `InitSafeBootMode` read (0),
then `CPUID` leaf `0x1` and the hypervisor leaf `0x40000000`. Under the older, host-
passthrough profile that trace exposed the host's own CPUID (`ECX=0xfffaf38b`, hypervisor
bit set) and a `Microsoft Hv` hypervisor leaf. The coherent CPU profile now presents a
bare-metal surface for exactly those reads — leaf `0x1` `ECX=0x7FFAB7FF` (bit 31 clear),
`0x40000000` empty — verified by the CPUID probe in the smoke driver
(`make_test_driver.py`, logged under `--diag`). The bounded ACPI/PCI/IOMMU model and the
VT-d advertisement in the CPUID/MSR surface back the IOMMU path. Re-running a fresh
`FACEIT_IOMMU.sys` against the current build is still required to confirm the next
rejection point; no FACEIT compatibility claim is made yet.

## Roadmap

- [x] Replace independent CPUID mutations with coherent platform profiles
- [x] Add branch and value-provenance tracing for early rejection paths (`--provenance`)
- [x] Generate Windows-build-specific kernel structure layouts from PDBs (`tools/pdb_layout`)
- [x] Add strict handling for unknown exports instead of ambiguous zero returns (`--strict-exports`)
- [x] Expand scheduler, IRQL, APC, DPC, timer and synchronization semantics
- [x] Model ACPI, PCI and IOMMU state for IOMMU-oriented drivers
- [x] Add deterministic trace replay and differential validation (`--trace` / `--check`)
- [x] Add automated smoke tests for PE mapping and emulator initialization (`tests/smoke.ps1`)
- [x] Fix import-resolution crash and harden PE export/import parsing (`ParseExport` bounds, `GetExport` lookups, null-safe `ResolveImport`)
- [x] Consume PDB-generated kernel layouts in the harness (`kernel_layout_consume.h`: `GEN_*` fixed-offset accesses, PDB-accurate ETHREAD via KTHREAD padding, drift `static_assert`s)
- [x] Advertise VT-d/VT-x pre-conditions coherently in the CPUID/MSR surface (`IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL` VMX-enabled, valid `IA32_VMX_BASIC`, sane IOMMU `CAP.ND`)
- [x] Deliver kernel APCs on the target thread's context, waking wait-blocked threads (per-thread wake events, inline `KernelRoutine`/`NormalRoutine`)
- [x] Validate the FACEIT CPUID rejection surface against the captured `FACEIT_IOMMU` trace: the coherent profile presents the bare-metal leaf `0x1` / empty `0x40000000` the driver checks (smoke-driver CPUID probe)

### Scheduler / IRQL / APC / DPC / timer / sync expansion

- Guest-visible IRQL is tracked in `KPCR.Irql` (offset `0x50`): `KeGetCurrentIrql`,
  `KfRaiseIrql`/`KeRaiseIrql` (return old), `KeLowerIrql`/`KfLowerIrql`,
  `KeRaiseIrqlToDpcLevel`. Spinlock acquire raises to `DISPATCH_LEVEL` and
  `KeReleaseSpinLock(lock, NewIrql)` restores it.
- Kernel APCs are queued per-thread (`KeInsertQueueApc` / `KeRemoveQueueApc`) and
  delivered at waits, `KeTestAlertThread`, `KeAlertThread` and self-targeted inserts;
  `KeEnter/LeaveCriticalRegion` and `KeAre(ApcsDisabled)` track the thread's `ApcDisable`
  counter. Kernel-APC `NormalRoutine` runs on a delivery thread (not the target's
  context) — see limitations.
- `KeInitializeDpc` now stores the deferred routine/context (it previously zeroed the
  object); `KeInsertQueueDpc` / `KeRemoveQueueDpc` run queued DPCs on a host worker.
- Timers support cancellation (`KeCancelTimer` actually prevents the DPC from firing)
  and periodic re-arm (`KeSetTimerEx` honours `Period`).

### ACPI / PCI / IOMMU (bounded baseline)

- `HalGetBusDataByOffset` returns a synthetic PCI config space (host bridge + a VT-d
  IOMMU device).
- `HalAcpiGetTableEx` returns a guest-resident, checksum-correct VT-d `DMAR` table
  describing one remapping unit at `0xFED90000`.
- `MmMapIoSpaceEx` on `0xFED90000` maps a coherent VT-d register block (version,
  capability, status) so `READ_REGISTER_*` against the IOMMU does not fault.

This model is shaped from the general shape of IOMMU-oriented drivers, not from a
captured trace of an actual target. Re-validate it against a real trace (e.g. a fresh
`FACEIT_IOMMU.sys` run) before relying on it for a specific driver.

### Smoke tests and layout generation

Automated smoke tests cover PE mapping and emulator initialization end-to-end:

```powershell
.\tests\smoke.ps1                 # builds, generates a minimal .sys, runs, asserts
.\tests\smoke.ps1 -SkipBuild      # reuse an existing build
```

`tests\make_test_driver.py` emits a minimal x64 native driver (no imports, a KPCR/GS read,
a conditional branch) that must return `STATUS_SUCCESS` for the test to pass. It first runs
the FACEIT-style CPUID probe (leaf `0x1` + `0x40000000`) so `--diag` runs show the coherent
bare-metal profile values. `--with-import` adds a single `ntoskrnl.exe!KeInitializeSpinLock`
import so the full import-resolution path (`ParseExport` on ntoskrnl, `ResolveImport`,
`BuildSentinelIat`) is exercised end-to-end.

Structure layouts for the actual target ntoskrnl PDB are generated with the DIA SDK:

```powershell
.\tools\pdb_layout.ps1            # -> generated\kernel_layout.h (GEN_<STRUCT>_<FIELD> defines)
```

The harness consumes these generated offsets through `KEVLAR\include\kernel_layout_consume.h`:
fixed-offset accesses (KPCR→KPRCB→CurrentThread, ETHREAD→KTHREAD back-pointers, EPROCESS
rundown-protect, APC-disable) are sourced from the `GEN_*` macros, the synthetic ETHREAD
layout is kept at the PDB size (KTHREAD tail padding in `ntoskrnl_struct.h`), and
compile-time `static_assert`s fail the build if a hardcoded struct drifts from the
generated offsets. Regenerate `generated\kernel_layout.h` after refreshing the target
ntoskrnl PDB and rebuild.

Remaining structural gap: the hardcoded `_KPROCESS`/`_EPROCESS` bodies predate the target
build (e.g. `UniqueProcessId` at `0x440` vs `0x1D0` on 26100), so EPROCESS fields other
than the ones the harness populates through the `GEN_` accessors are not PDB-accurate. The
harness's providers are self-consistent on those paths; direct driver probing of
non-populated EPROCESS fields is the known limit. Full accuracy needs `pdb_layout` to
emit typed struct definitions rather than offsets.

## Known limitations

- The included kernel structure definitions are based primarily on Windows 10 21H2 x64, with
  the harness-consumed offsets (ETHREAD/KTHREAD/KPCR/KPRCB and the fixed-offset accesses)
  tracked against the generated layout from the cached ntoskrnl PDB.
- Many kernel exports are simplified or intentionally stubbed.
- Unknown return values can alter downstream control flow.
- Host threads do not perfectly reproduce Windows scheduling and IRQL behavior.
- Kernel APCs deliver on the target thread's own context: `KernelRoutine`/`NormalRoutine`
  run inline on the target's engine (current ETHREAD/KPCR/stack are the target's), and a
  cross-thread APC signals a per-thread wake event so a wait-blocked thread is interrupted
  and delivers it in its wait loop instead of at an arbitrary future delivery point.
- The ACPI/PCI/IOMMU model is a bounded baseline: synthetic PCI config, a VT-d `DMAR`
  table, a coherent `0xFED90000` register block, and a CPUID/MSR surface that advertises
  the virtualization pre-conditions (`IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL` VMX-enabled, a valid
  `IA32_VMX_BASIC`). The register set is still minimal until a real IOMMU driver trace
  validates it.
- PnP, power, DMA, filter stacks and real device behavior are present but simplified
  (`IoCreateDevice`, `IoRegisterPlugPlayNotification`, `IofCompleteRequest`, MDL/DMA and
  contiguous-memory providers exist). They are extended only when a specific target
  driver is seen exercising a given path.
- Diagnostic mode can produce large traces and run substantially slower.
- Import resolution is fixed: `ParseExport` bounds-checks every export-table read (no more
  OOB name reads corrupting the export map), `GetExport`/`GetImport` use single lookups, and
  `ResolveImport` no longer crashes on a missing import module or ordinal thunk. A driver
  importing from a real cached `ntoskrnl.exe` resolves its IAT through
  `BuildSentinelIat`; coverage lives in `make_test_driver.py --with-import`.
